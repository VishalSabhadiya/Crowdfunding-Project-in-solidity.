# Crowdfunding-Project-in-solidity

- Developed and deployed a crowdfunding smart contract on Ethereum to enable secure fundraising. Designed features for managing contributions, setting goals, and handling refunds. 
- Additionally, created a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction and campaign tracking, ensuring transparency and efficient fund management throughout the campaign.

- In this Smart Contract Funds are collected from contributors to these smart contracts.  After that, the manager sends a request to withdraw funds.
- A manager can withdraw funds only if the majority of contributors approve the withdrawal.
- If the majority of contributors do not agree to fund, the manager may not take the funds and all collected funds will be returned to the account of the fund contributors.
